# midichkr

Simple app that prints out the hex bytes of midi messages from the first connected midi device.

## Build
- Install cmake
- Install a c++ compiler

Run the `build.sh` script (which just runs cmake) or use cmake directly.

Find the executable in the `cmake-build` directory depending on platform.

## Caveats
Only ever built/tested on windows, ymmv.
